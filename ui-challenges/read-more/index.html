            Thursday, according to authorities.

          <p>
            In a statement to PEOPLE, the New Jersey State Police (NJSP)
            confirmed that the fatal incident unfolded just before 3 p.m. in
            Hampton Township in Sussex County.
          </p>
          <p>
            State police said their troopers responded at 2:50 p.m. after
            receiving a report of a small aircraft crash and discovered two
            fatalities at the scene.

          <p>
            They were later identified as&nbsp;Glen M. de Vries, 49, of New
            York, New York, and Thomas P. Fischer, 54, of Hopatcong, New Jersey,
            &nbsp;NJSP confirmed.

          <p>
            The FAA has not identified who the pilot of the aircraft was.

            In their report, the FAA stated that the single-engine Cessna 172
            plane was "destroyed" in a heavily wooded area but the cause remains
            unknown. The FAA will be the lead investigating agency, according to
            NJSP.

            A 1994 graduate of Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in
            molecular biology and genetics, de Vries had an obsession with
            aerospace aviation since he was young, per

            Over the years, he read every book he could about rockets, aircraft
            and spaceships before training to pilot his own single-engine plane,
            his profile stated.

            In October, de Vries' longstanding dream of going to space finally
            came true when he
            <a
              href="https://people.com/human-interest/william-shatner-flies-to-space-history-making-launch/"
              >blasted into space</a

            with Shatner, as well as Audrey Powers, Blue Origin's vice president
            of mission and flight operations, and fellow crew member and
            co-founder of Planet Labs, Chris Boshuizen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking to Carnegie Mellon after the journey, de Vries said, "I
            honestly don't think anybody could go to space and not want to go to
            space more, so I would love to again."
          </p>
          <p>
            "I think I've taken that perspective [of a heightened sense of time]
            back down with me to our planet, and into my relationships," he
            added. "The passage of time, just like the resources on Earth, feels
            more precious with expanded perspective."
